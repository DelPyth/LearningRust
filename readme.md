# LearningRust
This repo is pretty much just a personal journey to learning Rust as I've gotten quite annoyed at C and C++, I'm waiting on Carbon to come out, and I despise the way Go handles files within its own project folder.

# Q and A
<details>
	<summary>Is there any benefit for me?</summary>

Probably not, this is a personal repo of learning Rust so I don't expect anyone else to learn something from this.
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Some things in this can be done differently/more efficiently/better overall...</summary>

Well duh. I'm still fucking learning. You're more than welcome to add an issue ticket but please keep it professional.
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Why not learn X, Y, Z?</summary>

I wanna learn Rust to get it on my personal record of languages that I know and can help others with. Plus, your X, Y, or Z isn't good enough for me.
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Will you abandon this when Carbon releases?</summary>

More than likely. But until then, I'm reading from the 2018 version of The Rust Programming Language book, so if you own that or know where to find a copy, feel free to follow along.
